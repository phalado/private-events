# Private-events

Private events is Microverse's seventh collaborative project in the Rails' course. The goal is to build a social community where the members create events and invite other members to it, like [Eventbrite][eventbrite-link]. Our project may appear incomplete in some aspects, but we fulfilled all the requirements.

## Link to assignment

The assignment for this project is in the Odin Project's Ruby on Rails course that can be found [here][assigment-link].

## Technologies used

In this project we only used Ruby on Rails and HTML.
